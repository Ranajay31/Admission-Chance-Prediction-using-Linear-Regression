# Admission-Chance-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Fitted a  linear regression model on a dataset to predict the chance of admission of a student into colleges based on certain factors like their GRE Score,TOEFL Score,University rating,etc.
Perfomed necessary data preprocessing steps.
Fitted the data into a linear regression model and checked for R-square and Adjusted R-square metrics for both training and test sets.
Also performed L1, L2 and Elastic Net regularization to check for overfitting.
Finally carried out a prediction for a given array.
